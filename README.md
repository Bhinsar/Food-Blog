# Food-Blog
Create a basic website in React.js and Node to add your food recipe online during my internship.

# Detail
It is my first full-stack project in which I have added private routes and a login functionality to add a  user, and they can also add recipes to this website.

# How to use
Download the zip  file of this repo.
Type
```npm i```
on the terminal to download the node packages and then type 
```npm start```
to run the server

Then access the website at
```http://localhost:3000```
